The results show that current allocaiton may lead to slight ineffiency, and the best way is to let the production sites focus on the most profitable mix of products. In this case, the CEO should review and adjust allocation of raw materials, cooking, and filtering capacities regularly. Is it also worth to inspect for the reason for the optimization suggesting CIB site to not product standard unit. Finally, the CEO should continue monitor the production effiency and resource allocation in the future to ensure good profit. \n",
