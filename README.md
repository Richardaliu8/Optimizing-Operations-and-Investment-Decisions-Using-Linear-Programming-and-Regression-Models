# Optimizing-Operations-and-Investment-Decisions-Using-Linear-Programming-and-Regression-Models  

Project Overview  
This project focuses on optimizing operations for a manufacturing company and investment decisions for a hotel chain using linear programming and regression models. It includes solving for profit maximization, analyzing profitability predictors, and applying optimization techniques to allocate resources efficiently and enhance decision-making.  

Features  
Operations Optimization: Developed linear programming models to maximize profit contributions for two production sites with constraints on cooking and filtering capacities and raw material availability.  
Joint Optimization: Created a combined model for both sites to achieve overall profit maximization and compared results with individual site optimizations.  
Profitability Analysis: Used a regression model to predict profitability for a hotel chain, identifying key predictors and their impacts.  
Investment Optimization: Implemented greedy and optimization models to select the most profitable hotels within a budget, ensuring resource allocation maximizes returns.  
Diversity Constraint: Enhanced the investment model by adding constraints to diversify hotel purchases across multiple cities.  

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to optimize operations and investment decisions through rigorous analysis and modeling. By leveraging linear programming and regression models, the study aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations for maximizing profits and making informed investment choices. These findings assist in improving operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation.
